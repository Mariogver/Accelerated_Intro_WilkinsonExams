Then, made a *grep* command with the *-E* flag for regular expressions and a *-io* to avoid case specificness and to show only the word required by the *grep*. In this case the AGI Locus code is formed by two possile letters (A-a) or (T-t) in the first two possitions, so [A-Z] means the must be letters and {2} specifies the two first positions. Then it comes the chromosome number, from [1-5] and another letter [A-Z]. The last 5 digits are numbers from [0-9] and the {5} is specified. The output of this *grep* is stored in a new file named Root-associated-LOci.txt. To make sure all AGI codes were taken, a *wc* command was used. Apparently the ABBA file is slightly bigger than the Root-associated... this is because some of the last ABBA lines do not show a AGI code, but a 4 character identificator wich could mean they do not have the AGI code or any other reason. Those unknown codes were not asked for and thus not extracted. A *cat* command is done to make sure the file created is ok, and after that both are removed so the next time this script runs they wont be overwritten."

Its number of lines are displayed for further comprobations with the *wc -l* command.

Theoutput is stored in a file named Root-associated-Publication.txt, and the number of lines displayed by *wc*. But the lines inside Root-associated... was way smaller than ABBA file (558 vs 628). In order to assure that all the pubmed ids were correctly extracted I did a *cat* command with the *-n* flag to see the line number, so whenever I found a disonance between the ABBA line number and the Root... line number (remember that the *grep* that extracted the ABBA from the Locus_Germplasm file had the -n flag, and theorically all lines containing a phenotype should have a pubmed id, thus the file should had same number of lines and each line the same number). \n",

    "The AGI locus code states that the third caracter (number from 1-5) refers to the number of chromosome the gene is located in. THus, if the hypothesis is correct we should find in root associated genes' AGIs examples of all numbers from 1 to 5 at least once. To demonstrate this and as done in pervious excercises I isolated the \"root\" cointaining phenotypes and stored them in a file named ABBA. After that I isolated the AGI codes just like in excercise 7 on another file named Root-associated-Loci.txt. By doing several *grep* on that file looking for the specificity on the third character (*\\w{2}* first two leters don't matter, third charecter ranging from 1 to 5 and another unimportant 6 word characters *\\w{6}*) and storing each possible output in a different file (Chr 1 to 5, meaning chromosomes 1 to 5), I can then classify the AGIs of the genes according to the chromosome they are found on. If all of those new archives have at least one AGI this would mean that our hypothesis is correct, this can be proved by measuring the number of lines in each file with a simple *wc -l* command. After demonstrating that indeed genes assocaited with roots can be found on all chromosomes, I removed all files to avoid overwritting."
